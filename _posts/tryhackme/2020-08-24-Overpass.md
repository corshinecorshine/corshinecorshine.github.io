## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Summary</span>**
***
- Modify the cookie to get `ssh key` from the `/admin`
- Crack the `ssh key` with john
- `Ssh` as **James**
- Modify the `/etc/hosts` to our `tun0` ip
- Create the same directory in our machine `/downloads/src`
- Create the script with the same name which is `buildscript.sh` as reverse shell
- Start the listener, and `Root`

From the nmap scan, we found 2 ports are open, `22` as ssh and `80` that running golang http server.

While running `Gobuster`, We check the website on browser and found nothing interesting from it.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Check the website</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/websiteX.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Gobuster</span>**
***

Looking at the result from `Gobuster`, it shows `/admin` directory, so lets check that out.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/gobusterX.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Bypass the admin directory</span>**
***

It redirects us to `login` form which I tried to perform **SQL injection** and failed.

By looking at the `source code` and click the `javascript` code that brings us to function which has a simple if else statements, its checking for a cookie that called SessionToken, so I figured it out just by creating a cookie and give any random value, we will get something from the page.

So we press `ctrl+shift+i` and add the `name` as Session Token.

By refreshing the page, it shows us the private ssh keys of **James**.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Cracking the hash</span>**
***

Add it as a new file, we can call the file with any names, and `chmod 600` the file otherwise it won't work when we `ssh` into the machine.

It shows the potential user is `James`, we fire up `ss2john.py` and make it to hash that john can read in order to crack it, we also can use hashcat.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Get in as user</span>**
***

So we try to get in as `James` and now we can read `user.txt`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/usertxtX.png" | relative_url }})

***

Also there is `todo.txt`, so lets cat it out.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Privilege Escalation to root</span>**
***

After looking around, I decided to just run `linpeas` and let's see what happens after that.

We send `linpeas` from our machine 

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/pythonsendlinpeasX.png" | relative_url }})

***

And we download the linpeas as `James`

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/downloadlinpeasX.png" | relative_url }})

***

From the linpeas's result, we found there is crontab that execute the particular script.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/crontab1X.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/crontab2X.png" | relative_url }})

***

And surprisingly we have access to write `/etc/hosts` which usually only `root` user is able to do that.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/hostcanwriteX.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Quick Brief</span>**
***

Let me **explain** how this is going to work, 

We can see the crontab is executing a particular script which leads to `overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh`, and we are able to modify the `/etc/hosts` and change `overpass.thm` to our `tun0` ip which let the machine downloads the file from our machine and execute.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/etchostsmodifX.png" | relative_url }})

***

So here after modified the `/etc/hosts`, we need to create the same directory as shows on the crontab.

And we can do anything with the file, `SUID Hijack`, `Reverse Shell`, `Cat the root.txt` etc.

I put my python reverse shell in the `buildscript.sh`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/pyscriptrevshellX.png" | relative_url }})

***

We need to start python server from our machine in order to let the machine download our fake `buildscript.sh` 

![]({{ "/images/thm/overpass/pythonserverX.png" | relative_url }})

***

And also start the listener with `netcat`.
