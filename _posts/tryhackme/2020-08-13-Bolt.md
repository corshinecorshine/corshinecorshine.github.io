## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Summary</span>**
***
- Special port for **User CMS**
- Default Apache without special directories
- **User** and **Password** is on the webpage.
- Vulnerable to (RCE) **Remote Code Execution**
- Exploit with **metasploit** to get shell.
- Search for the **flag**.



## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Port scan</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/nmap.png" | relative_url }})


## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Check port 80</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/defaultapache.png" | relative_url }})

It's default apache page which nothing **interesting**.

I decided to run **Gobuster,Dirb & Rustbuster against it** with no `LOOTS`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/gobuster.png" | relative_url }})


## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Check other port</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/boltpage.png" | relative_url }})

It redirects me to **CMS** site which has numerous of **potential users**, after looking around, I found the valid **credentials**.


> Username

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/username1.png" | relative_url }})

> Password

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/passwd1.png" | relative_url }})

Based on the website, it shows many links that pointed out to the **user**, so I decided to browse `10.10.161.84:secretport/user` and it redirects to the login page.

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/loginpage.png" | relative_url }})

Tried numerous of default **credentials** with no lucks, so let's move on and save it for later on.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Found RCE</span>**
***

I decided to search around with **searchsploit** and found this **CMS** has **Authenticated RCE**.

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/searchsploit1.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Metasploit</span>**
***

Fired up **msfconsole** and search **bolt_authenticated cms**.

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/metasploit1.png" | relative_url }})

Now it seems things getting easier, everyone knows how to use this stuff (***metasploit***).

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/metasploit2.png" | relative_url }})

And I'm in as **root**....

After few seconds, I realized the flag is not in ***root*** dir, the box kinda different because flag should always be in `/root`.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Searching for the flag!</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/root1.png" | relative_url }})

By executing `find` commands, I may easily get the **flag**.

```
root@bolt:~# find / -type f -name "*.txt"
```

If you are using **TMUX**, press **prefix+/ & ctrl+s**, then search for **flag.txt**.


![]({{ "/images/thm/bolt/root2.png" | relative_url }})



## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Capture root</span>**
***


Capture it....
