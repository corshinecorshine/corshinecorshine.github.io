## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Summary</span>**
***
- Robots.txt gives special `directory`.
- Open the directory and get the files.
- Get the files from `FTP`.
- Bruteforce the `credentials`.
- Login into the website.
- Upload `php` reverse shell.
- Capture user.txt.
- Escalate to other `user`.
- Run `linpeas`.
- Edit the script that being executed with `crontab`.
- Rooted.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Port Scan</span>**
***

We found several ports are open, `21,22 and 80`.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Check the website</span>**
***


By checking the website, it gives us default **apache** page, manual search `robots.txt` shows interesting information.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/robots.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/website.png" | relative_url }})

***

It tells us a hint which there is another directory, let's check the directory.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/admindir.png" | relative_url }})

***

We found there are 2 credentials which potentially needs to be `bruteforced` in order to login.
I used command `wget` to download those files to my machine.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/creds.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>FTP</span>**
***

Because we still don't know what is the purposes of these credentials, I decided to check `FTP` with anonymous login.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/ftp2.png" | relative_url }})

***

There is a file from `FTP` that shows us a special directory

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/isi.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Bruteforce the credentials</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/loginform.png" | relative_url}})

***

It brought us to login form which now makes sense that we need to bruteforce the credentials to login.
I decided to use `hydra` to bruteforce the login forms.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/hydra.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Reverse shell</span>**
***

Now we have the valid credential to login, after successfully login with `enox`, we can upload files to the site, which we can abuse with `php-reverse-shell`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/phprevshell1.png" | relative_url }})

***

We need to change the IP and PORT, you can check your own `tun0 IP` and changed the file name to make it easier.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/phprevshell2.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/changefilephp.png" | relative_url }})

***

After successfully uploaded our file, we check the directory and yes there is our file being uploaded.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/confirmfile.png" | relative_url }})

***

Now we need to open our file in the url bar and don't forget to set listener with `netcat`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/revshell1.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/nc1.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Capture user.txt</span>**
***

We successfully got in as www-data and we can read **user.txt**.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/usertxt.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Escalate to another user</span>**
***

By running `sudo -l`, we found that user `thirtytwo` is able to execute `/var/www/gdb` with **sudo**.

We check `gtfobins` to see how to escalate to another user with `gdb`.

> [GTFOBINS - GDB](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gdb/)


![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/gdb.png" | relative_url }})

***

We need to execute the command as `thirtytwo` because the user has the privilege to execute `gdb`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/execgdb.png" | relative_url }})

***

Now we are on `thirtytwo`, by running `sudo -l` **again**, we found user `d4rckh` is able to run `git`.

We need to check `gtfobins` again to see how to escalate to next user with `git`.

> [GTFOBINS - GIT](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git/)

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/git.png" | relative_url }})

***

Execute it.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/execgit.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Get in with ssh</span>**
***

And now we are on `d4rckh`, because we still using **reverse-shell**, and I'm afraid that we might get laggy or accidentally press `ctrl+c`, I decided create a ssh key as `d4rckh` and put my `ssh` public key on `authorized_keys` of `d4rckh` so I can ssh to it and not redo the whole things if something bad happens.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/sshkeygen.png" | relative_url }})

***

And now we need to echo the public key to `authorized_keys`, so we can login directly to `d4rckh` without password.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/echossh.png" | relative_url }})

***

Now let's try to ssh as `d4rckh`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/ssh1.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Enumerate deeper</span>**
***

At this point, I decided to run `linpeas` to enumerate deeper and found a python script and surprisingly `crontab` is executing.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/runlinpeas.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/vuln1.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/vuln2.png" | relative_url }})

***

We also found port 3306 which running `Mysql` but we can ignore it for now and continue to abuse the script that running on `crontab`.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/crontab1.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Escalate to root</span>**
***

This is the default script and we are able to edit the script to get root shell.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/defaultscript.png" | relative_url }})

***

And after modified the script, I decided to put simeple script and setup the listener with `netcat`.

Wait for a while and the listener finally responded with **root shell**.

![]({{ "/images/thm/tartarus/roottxt.png" | relative_url }})
