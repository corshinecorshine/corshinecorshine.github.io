***

- Adding new host to `/etc/hosts`
- Found LFI on 8080
- Getting credentials of tomcat on **tomcat-users.xml**
- Create paylaod with `msfvenom`
- Upload the payload with `curl`
- Execute the file on browser to get **reverse shell**
- Get in as `Tomcat`
- PrivEsc to `Ash` by cracking password of zip file on `/var/www/html/files`
- Log in as `Ash`
- PrivEsc to root by abusing lxd-group

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Port Scan</span>**
***

We found port `22`,`80` and `8080` which running tomcat.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Website</span>**
***

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/website.png" | relative_url }})

***

By checking the website, we found `megahosting.htb` host which we need to add it on our `/etc/hosts` otherwise we can't go to `megahosting.htb/news`.

After clicked `NEWS`, we found LFI which we can execute command inside the parameter.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/LFI.png" | relative_url }})

***

We tried to login on port 8080 with default creds of `tomcat` but failed.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/tomcatdefaultcred.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/tomcat-users.png" | relative_url }})

***

So we need to get the credentials, I decided to check the `tomcat-user.xml`, 

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/tomcat1.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/tomcat2.png" | relative_url }})

***

By checking the directory `/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml` and the source code, we found the user and password of tomcat which is **tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!**.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Gobuster</span>**
***

I also fire up `gobuster` to enum other files/dirs didn't find any interesting stuffs.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/gobuster.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Create and send payload</span>**
***

Tomcat gives us permission that able to **create, delete, and manage** virtual hosts with `curl`.
So I decided to create payload and send it with `curl`.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/payload.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/sendpayload.png" | relative_url }})

***

To make sure that our payload is in there, we can check it.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/listpayload.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Reverse Shell</span>**
***

After everything went smooth now we can fire up listener and go to the path that our payload was sent.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/revshell1.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/revshell2.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Enumeration inside the machine</span>**
***

We fire up `linpeas` to enumerate things inside this machine 

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/linpeas1.png" | relative_url }})

***

And found a backup file in particular directory.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/linpeas2.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Cracking the zip</span>**
***

We try to su as `ash` but got permission denied, so we have to move forward by geting the zip file and examine in our machine.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/sendzip.png" | relative_url }})

***

The zip asked for a password, so I decided to use `zip2john` to crack this zip file.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/askforpassword.png" | relative_url }})

***

After getting the hash of the zip with `zip2john`, now we can crack it with `JohnTheRipper` to get the password of the zip file.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/crackpass.png" | relative_url }})

***

After unzip the `zip` file, I found nothing interesting inside, so by guessing this is the `Ash` password, I headed to the shell again and su as `Ash`.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/logasash.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Login as Ash</span>**
***

And now we can read `user.txt` inside the machine.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/usertxt.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/idofash.png" | relative_url }})

***

By running `id` as `Ash`, we found `Ash` is in the **lxd group**.

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Escalating to root</span>**
***

After few minutes of searching, I found one article that related and one github repository that we should clone to our machine.

> [lxd-privilege-escalation](https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation/)

> [Github - lxd-alpine-builder](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder)

After cloning the repo, we need to build it and the output will be `tar` file 

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/buildalpine.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/targzalpine.png" | relative_url }})

***

Now we need to send it to the machine.

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/sendalpine.png" | relative_url }})

***

> **The commands that we need to run**

```
lxd init
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20200623_0439.tar.gz --alias corshineimage
lxc image list
lxc init corshineimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
```

After initialize the lxd, we need to import the image with alias so we know that which one is our image and we need to list the image

![]({{ "/images/htb/tabby/listofimage.png" | relative_url }})

***

After we mount the `/root` directory to `/mnt/root` directory, now we can read `root` flag.
